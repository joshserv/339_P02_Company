            <h2>Welcome to the Club</h2>
            <p>Dedicated to the sophisticated gangsters and the radical gentlemen, Ogle is the finest collection of men's eyewear. Drawing from icons from the likes of Kanye West, David Beckham, and Johnny Depp, we at the club pay homage to the real originals, while paving our own appearances, careers, and lifestyle. Characterized by the gritty elegance of each pair of "OGs" /ō'jēz/, our lenses speak to the confident and estimable men behind them.</p>

            <h2>Behind the Lenses</h2>
            <p class="story-2">All of our frames are hand crafted in Japan by world class designers. Unique influences and global exposure results in a creative process with endless possibilities. We draw inspiration for our frames from the places, people and experiences we interact with. This allows us to include our communities in the process and benefit from the experiences of our friends.</p>
            <p>We source quality materials to create products with integrity - we only settle for the best. From our acetate and metals through to our lenses and eye care equipment, we take the time to find the best producers around the world. We are proud of our suppliers, and we ensure standards are met by building strong personal relationships with the owners.</p>
